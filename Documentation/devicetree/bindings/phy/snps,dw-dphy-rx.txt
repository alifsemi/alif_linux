Synopsys DSI PHY for Alif Ensemble SoC

The Synopsys MIPI-DSI PHY IP block is e.g. found on Alif Ensemble platforms.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be:
  - "snps,dw-dphy-rx"
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- reg: the register range of the PHY controller
- bus-width: Number of data lines. Should be <12>.
- snps,dphy-frequency: the phy core clk frequency, should be: 400000000
- snps,phy_type: Should be <1>
- #phy-cells: number of cells in PHY, as defined in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/phy-bindings.txt
  this must be <1>

Example:
mipi_dphy_rx:  dphy@49033040 {
	compatible = "snps,dw-dphy-rx";
	reg = <0x49033040 0x40>;
	#phy-cells = <1>;
	bus-width = <12>;
	clocks = <&syst_pclk>;
	snps,dphy-frequency = <400000000>;
	snps,phy_type = <1>;
};
