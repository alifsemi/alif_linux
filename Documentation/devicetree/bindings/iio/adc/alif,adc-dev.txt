Alif ADC12/ADC24 device driver

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "alif,adc-dev"
- reg: Address and length of the device's register set.
- clock-names: List of input clocks.
  Required elements: "apb_pclk"
- clocks: Input clock specifier. Refer to common clock bindings.


Examples:
adc0: adc12_0@49020000 {
	compatible = "alif,adc-dev";
	reg = <0x49020000 0x100>;
	clocks = <&syst_pclk 0>;
	clock-names = "apb_pclk" ;
	status = ADC120_STATUS;
};
adc1: adc12_1@49021000 {
	compatible = "alif,adc-dev";
	reg = <0x49021000 0x100>;
	clocks = <&syst_pclk 0>;
	clock-names = "apb_pclk" ;
	status = ADC121_STATUS;
};
adc2: adc12_2@49022000 {
	compatible = "alif,adc-dev";
	reg = <0x49022000 0x100>;
	clocks = <&syst_pclk 0>;
	clock-names = "apb_pclk" ;
	status = ADC122_STATUS;
};
