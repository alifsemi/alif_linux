Alif Ensemble PCM audio CODEC

Required properties:
 - compatible: "alif,alif-pcm"
 - pinctrl-names: Should contain only one value - "default"
 - pinctrl-0: Should specify pin control groups used for this controller.
 - reg: Base address and size of the IP core instance.
 - interrupts-parent: Phandle for interrupt controller.
 - interrupts: List of Interrupt numbers.
 - clock-names: List of input clocks.
   Required elements: "pclk"
 - clocks: Input clock specifier. Refer to common clock bindings.

Example:
pcm: pcm@4902D000 {
	compatible = "alif,alif-pcm";
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_pcm0>;
	reg = <0x4902D000 0x800>;
	clocks = <&syst_pclk 0>;
	clock-names = "pclk";
	interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
	interrupts = <0 134 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	status = PCM_STATUS;
};
