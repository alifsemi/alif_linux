Alif Ensemble Camera Controller CPI device driver
=================================================

Required properties:
- #address-cells: Should be <1>.
- #size-cells: Should be <0>.
- pinctrl-names: Should contain only one value - "default"
- pinctrl-0: Should specify pin control groups used for this controller.
- compatible: Must be "alif,ensemble-cpi"
- reg: the register base and size for the device registers
- interrupts-parent: Phandle for interrupt controller.
- interrupts: the interrupt for the device.
- clocks: Phandles to device clocks.
          Must be <&camera_pixclk>.
- clock-names: Must be "camera_pixclk".
- port: child port node, in accordance with the video interface
        bindings defined in
        Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.
        The port node must contain at least one endpoint.

Example:
--------
cpi:  camera_ctrl@49030000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_camera>;
	compatible = "alif,ensemble-cpi";
	reg = <0x49030000 0x1000>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 334 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&camera_pixclk>;
	clocks-names = "camera_pixclk";
	status = "ok";
	port {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		cpi_csi2_in: endpoint@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			remote-endpoint = <&csi2_out>;
		};
	};
};
