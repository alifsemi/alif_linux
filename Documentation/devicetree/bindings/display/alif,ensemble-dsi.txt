Display Serial Interface in Alif Ensemble SoC
=============================================

DSI Controller:
Required properties:
- #address-cells: Should be <1>.
- #size-cells: Should be <0>.
- compatible: Should be "alif,ensemble-dsi"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers of controller
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the DSI block.
- clocks: Phandles to device clocks.
          Must be <&dpi_pixclk>, <&pllref>, and <&cfgclk>
- clock-names: Must be "pclk", "ref", "cfgclk".
- ports: A node containing DSI input & output port nodes with endpoint
  definitions as documented in [3] & [4].
  - port@0: DSI input port node, connected to the ltdc rgb output port.
  - port@1: DSI output port node, connected to a panel or a bridge input port.
- panel or bridge node: A node containing the panel or bridge description as
  documented in [6].
  - port: panel or bridge port node, connected to the DSI output port (port@1).

Example:

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "alif,ensemble-dsi";
	reg = <0x49032000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 332 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&dpi_pixclk>,
		 <&pllref>,
		 <&cfgclk>;
	clock-names = "pclk", "ref", "cfgclk";
	status = "okay";

	ports {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			dsi_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint =
					<&cdc_out1_rgb>;
			};
		};
		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			dsi_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint =
					<&panel_dsi>;
			};
		};
	};
	paneldsi: panel-dsi@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		compatible = "focuslcd,fw405";
		/* reset-gpios = <&gpio4 6 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>; */
		backlight = <&panel_backlight>;
		power-supply = <&reg_3p3v>;
		status = "okay";

		port {
			panel_dsi: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&dsi_out>;
			};
		};
	};
};
